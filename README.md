# Facial Keypoint Recognition

In this project, I combined my knowledge in the field of Computer Vision methods and Deep Learning architecture to create a system for recognizing keypoints of the face. I've used the PyTorch framework since it's quite flexible for high-quality parametre settings.</br>

All my process of neural network model development is written down in Jupyter Notebook; `data_loading.py` file contains different methods for preparing our data and our future model for training, `models.py` file contains implemented model.</br>
